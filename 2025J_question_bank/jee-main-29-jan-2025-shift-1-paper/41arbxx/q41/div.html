   Given below are two statements : one is labelled as  Assertion  (A) and the other is labelled as Reason (R).
   <br/>
   <b>
    Assertion
   </b>
   (A) : Emission of electrons in photoelectric effect can be suppressed by applying a sufficiently negative electron potential to the photoemissive substance.
   <br/>
   <b>
    Reason
   </b>
   (R) : A negative electric potential, which stops the emission of electrons from the surface of a photoemissive substance, varies linearly with frequency of incident radiation.
   <br/>
