   (B) The number of ions per unit volume that carry current in a solution increases on dilution.
   <br/>
   (C) Molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration.
   <br/>
   (D) The variation in molar conductivity is different for strong and weak electrolysis.
   <br/>
   (E) For weak electrolysis, the change in molar conductivity with dilution is due to decrease in degree of dissociation.
