   In photoelectric effect
   <br/>
   A. The photocurrent is proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation.
   <br/>
   B. Maximum Kinetic energy with which photoelectrons are emitted depends on the intensity of incident light.
   <br/>
   C. Max K.E with which photoelectrons are emitted depends on the frequency of incident light.
   <br/>
   D. The emission of photoelectrons require a minimum threshold intensity of incident radiation.
   <br/>
